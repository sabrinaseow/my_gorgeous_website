### About me
I'm a Malaysian and I graduated from The University of Manchester back in 2019 with a degree in Information Technology Management for Business. Post-graduation, I landed myself a job as an Associate Consultant in Ernst & Young Malaysia and I was there until just about a few months ago, where I quitted and decided to further my studies. Though my bachelors degree might sound very technical, I actually have only very little experience in coding. Hence, I look forward to upskilling myself and gain the technical capabilities I lack. 

**Random facts about me**:

* I speak four languages - *English*, *Mandarin*, *Cantonese* & *Malay*
* I am the youngest in the family. I have two older brothers 
* I used to not exercise at all but ever since I was introduced to indoor cycling, my lifestyle have changed completely
* I can't live without coffee
