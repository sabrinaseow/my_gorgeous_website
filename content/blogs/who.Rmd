My name is **Sabrina Seow** and I'm from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Realising data increasingly becomes the beacon for companies navigating their way through an intricate world, resulting in a paradigm shift in the mode of decision making where the locus lies towards information rather than intuition, I decided to be a proponent of this revolution rather than a mere bystander. Observing a glaring gap in my skill set to discern valid conclusions from data, the desire to address it provided my primary motivation to learn analytics. 

I have a degree in Information Technology Management for Business from The University of Manchester, professional experience in Consulting at Ernst & Young, and am currently reading for Masters in Analytics and Management in London Business School. 

**Facts about me**:

* I speak four languages - *English*, *Mandarin*, *Cantonese* & *Malay*
* I love indoor cycling, the ones similar to **SoulCycle**
* I love meeting new people, experiencing new cultures and am genuinely interested in people and their stories 

The best way to get to know me is to spend time with me over coffee, but this is a good start. Feel free to reach out to me anytime!
