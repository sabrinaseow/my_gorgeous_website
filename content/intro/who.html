<script src="/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js"></script>


<p>My name is <strong>Sabrina Seow</strong> and Iâ€™m from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Realising data increasingly becomes the beacon for companies navigating their way through an intricate world, resulting in a paradigm shift in the mode of decision making where the locus lies towards information rather than intuition, I decided to be a proponent of this revolution rather than a mere bystander. Observing a glaring gap in my skill set to discern valid conclusions from data, the desire to address it provided my primary motivation to learn analytics.</p>
<p>I have a degree in Information Technology Management for Business from The University of Manchester, professional experience in Consulting at Ernst &amp; Young, and am currently reading for Masters in Analytics and Management in London Business School.</p>
<p><strong>Facts about me</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I speak four languages - <em>English</em>, <em>Mandarin</em>, <em>Cantonese</em> &amp; <em>Malay</em></li>
<li>I love indoor cycling, the ones similar to <strong>SoulCycle</strong></li>
<li>I love meeting new people, experiencing new cultures and am genuinely interested in people and their stories</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to get to know me is to spend time with me over coffee, but this is a good start. Feel free to reach out to me anytime!</p>
